### Other things

1. You can see all the past day block without any events will show the deep gray color, today and all the future day block without any events will show the light gray.

2. You can put your mouse on the block, it will show the date. And you can also click it to see the date.

3. You'd better to use this website in PC end. Even though I have done the adaptation of mobile end, because the purpose is to show the whole year's events, it will have a better visual effect in PC end.
