Use "A" or "D" to move the swordman.(Player1 as an example)

Use "J" to do attacking action, and the swordman will also move a little bit distance.

Use "H" to do jumping action

You can also jump more than once in order to climb the wall.

When you attack the other swordman, and the other swordman doesn't do attacking action at the same time. <br>
(1) You kill him and the screen will flashing two times<br>
(2) The other swordman will go back to the initial position<br>
(3) The box will show a picture that you need to save<br>

When the picture shows, what you need to do is to jump and touch the picture in order to save the girl. After finish that, you will get a gold star, like below. When you get two star, you will win the game! But remember if you were killed, the box will be closed, you should kill the other swordman again!

### Other things

1. You can see all the past day block without any events will show the deep gray color, today and all the future day block without any events will show the light gray.

2. You can put your mouse on the block, it will show the date. And you can also click it to see the date.

3. You'd better to use this website in PC end. Even though I have done the adaptation of mobile end, because the purpose is to show the whole year's events, it will have a better visual effect in PC end.
